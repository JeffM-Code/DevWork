# DevWork 
One app mostly done in: release-builds/crusadia-win32-x64/crusadia.exe, for demonstration of concepts ive been studying.
To run app, place the release-builds directory into Documents as the app will look for relevant files from the documents folder, and will also need Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable x64: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170 as well to run app. The code for the app is in: app-sources/ so if the executable in release builds doesnt work, its possible to build the electron app with that code.
Working on cleaning up code and other aspects of app for release such as ensuring better dynamic file path handling (works regardless of Document folder placement), and working on including other full stack applications to repo.
