# DevWork 
Main app is an electron app "db-electron" for demonstration of concepts ive been studying. Still resolving pathing issues as I need to ensure all necessary files made and read from the app's source for better user experience.
To run app, will need Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable x64: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170 when built, but file pathing still being worked on so the backend wont be fully functional if built right now, as files are not being read in correct places, so working on that and more quality of life changes to app too, and also attempting to include diverse full stack applications as well to repo.
