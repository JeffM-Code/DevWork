# DevWork 
One app mostly done in: release-builds/crusadia-win32-x64/crusadia.exe, for demonstration of concepts ive been studying.
To run app, place the release-builds directory into Documents as the app will look for relevant files from the documents folder, and will also need Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable x64 as well to run app: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
Working on cleaning up code and other aspects of app for release, and working on including other full stack applications to repo.
